### About the dataset:
* This dataset contains 2 tables, in csv format
* The <i><b>Listings</i></b> table contains over 250,000 Airbnb listings from 10 of the worldâ€™s most visited cities (each record represents one listing), with fields containing details about the host, location, price, type, ratings, etc.
* The <i><b>Reviews</i></b> table contains over 5,000,000 Airbnb reviews from the same 10 cities (each record represents one review), with fields containing the listing id, review date, and reviewer id
 
NOTE: We omitted the review text to reduce file size, but it's fair game to include if you can find and integrate that data into your model!
